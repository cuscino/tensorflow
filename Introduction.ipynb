    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow is a general-purpose system for graph-based computation. A typical use is machine learning. In this notebook, we'll introduce the basic concepts of TensorFlow using some simple examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow gets its name from [tensors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor), which are arrays of arbitrary dimensionality. A vector is a 1-d array and is known as a 1st-order tensor. A matrix is a 2-d array and a 2nd-order tensor. The \"flow\" part of the name refers to computation flowing through a graph. Training and inference in a neural network, for example, involves the propagation of matrix computations through many nodes in a computational graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you think of doing things in TensorFlow, you might want to think of creating tensors (like matrices), adding operations (that output other tensors), and then executing the computation (running the computational graph). In particular, it's important to realize that when you add an operation on tensors, it doesn't execute immediately. Rather, TensorFlow waits for you to define all the operations you want to perform. Then, TensorFlow optimizes the computation graph, deciding how to execute the computation, before generating the data. Because of this, a tensor in TensorFlow isn't so much holding the data as a placeholder for holding the data, waiting for the data to arrive when a computation is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "A TensorFlow graph is a description of computations. To compute anything, a graph must be launched in a Session. A Session places the graph ops onto Devices, such as CPUs or GPUs, and provides methods to execute them. These methods return tensors produced by ops as [numpy](www.numpy.org) ndarray objects in Python, and as tensorflow::Tensor instances in C and C++.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use TensorFlow you need to understand how TensorFlow:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Represents computations as graphs.\n",
    "- Executes graphs in the context of Sessions.\n",
    "- Represents data as tensors.\n",
    "- Maintains state with Variables.\n",
    "- Uses feeds and fetches to get data into and out of arbitrary operations."

    "# The computation graph\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow programs are usually structured into a construction phase, that assembles a graph, and an execution phase that uses a session to execute ops in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, it is common to create a graph to represent and train a neural network in the construction phase, and then repeatedly execute a set of training ops in the graph in the execution phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow can be used from C, C++, and Python programs. It is presently much easier to use the Python library to assemble graphs, as it provides a large set of helper functions not available in the C and C++ libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The session libraries have equivalent functionalities for the three languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building the graph\n",
    "\n",
    "To build a graph start with ops that do not need any input (source ops), such as Constant, and pass their output to other ops that do computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ops constructors in the Python library return objects that stand for the output of the constructed ops. You can pass these to other ops constructors to use as inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The TensorFlow Python library has a default graph to which ops constructors add nodes. The default graph is sufficient for many applications. See the [Graph class](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.10/api_docs/python/framework.html#Graph) documentation for how to explicitly manage multiple graphs."
